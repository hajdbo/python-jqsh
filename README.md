**jqsh** is a shell based on [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

We are currently working on a rough draft, but there is a very basic [repl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). To run it, place the package in your `sys.path`, then run `python3 -m jqsh`. To exit the loop, press control-D.

For more info on the project, see [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/fenhl/jqsh/wikis/home).
